# CHECKING PLAYING STRATEGY OF TEAMS IN KNOCKOUT V/S NON-KNOCKOUT MATCHES

CONCLUSION
Generally teams play more agressive in 2nd half as compared to first half be it knockout or non- knockout tournaments.

In knockout Tournaments , Mexico only scored in First half, either they are defending in second half and maintaining the lead.

In knockout Tournaments countries Romaniya , Pero play with same agression in both the halves of the game.

Spain have very different strategy they place with almost equal agression in non knockout matches , however in knowckout matches they follow different plan , on first half they are into passive state (not scoring much) , however in second half they retaliate very voilently. Infact goals scored by them in first half and extra time are equal in number.

Canada never reached a knowckout stage , and even in non knockout stages they never scored a goal in second half. This can be their scope of improvement area , as they not scoring in the second half may be the reason they never made it to knockouts.

# DOES SUBSTITUTION TURNS OUT TO BE FRUITFULL  OR NOT FOR THE TEAM.

CONCLUSIONS
No Team substituted player scored goal in FIFA.

Teams like France , Argentina , Portugal , Australia , Germany , Spain , Netherland have very high or positive impact of subsutituion on overall score of the team.

Positive impact of the substituion signifies that these teams have a strong management that act accourdingly , as these teams are also the top teams of FIFA, these effective substution may be one of the reason why these teams are most favourite teams of the world.

A team can rely on substituted player for overall improvement of score but not for the goals to be scored by substituted player.
